Example:

highest_building([[0, 0, 1, 0],
                  [1, 0, 1, 1],
                  [1, 1, 1, 1],
                  [1, 1, 1, 1]]) == [3, 4]
# building â„–3 is the highest, with height = 4

How it is used: Every true programmer should know how to work with the 2D-arrays.

Precondition:
array width <= 10
array height <= 10
There is only 1 highest building in each array
