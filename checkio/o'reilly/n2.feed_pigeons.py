I start to feed one of the pigeons. A minute later two more fly by and a minute after that another 3. Then 4, and so on (Ex: 1+2+3+4+...). One portion of food lasts a pigeon for a minute, but in case there's not enough food for all the birds, the pigeons who arrived first ate first. Pigeons are hungry animals and eat without knowing when to stop. If I have N portions of bird feed, how many pigeons will be fed with at least one portion of wheat?

pigeons
Input: A quantity of portions wheat as a positive integer.

Output: The number of fed pigeons as an integer.

Example:

checkio(1) == 1
checkio(2) == 1
checkio(5) == 3
checkio(10) == 6
    
How it is used: This task illustrates how we can model various situations. Of course, the model has a limited approximation, but often-times we don't need a perfect model.

Precondition: 0 < N < 105.

我开始喂鸽子。再过一分钟，又飞了两下，又过了一分钟，又飞了三次。然后是4，等等(Ex:1 +2+3+4 +…)一份食物可以维持一分钟，但是如果没有足够的食物给所有的鸟，最先到达的鸽子先吃。鸽子是饥饿的动物，吃东西时不知道什么时候停下来。如果我有N份鸟类饲料，那么至少有一份小麦会喂养多少只鸽子?
鸽子

输入:小麦作为正整数的量。
输出:作为整数喂养的鸽子的数量。

如何使用:这个任务说明了我们如何建模各种情况。当然，这个模型的近似是有限的，但通常我们不需要一个完美的模型。
