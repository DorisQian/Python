There are four substring missions that were born all in one day and you shouldn’t be needed more than one day to solve them. All of those mission can be simply solved by brute force, but is it always the best way to go? (you might not have access to all of those missions yet, but they are going to be available with more opened islands on the map).

A very similar to the first is the second mission of the series with only one distinction is that you should look in a completely different way. You need to find the first longest substring with all unique letters. For example, in substring "abca" we have two substrings with unique letters "abc" and "bca", but we should take the first one, so the answer is "abc".

Input: String.

Output: String.

Example:

non_repeat('aaaaa') == 'a'
non_repeat('abdjwawk') == 'abdjw'
non_repeat('abcabcffab') == 'abcf'

有四个子串任务都是在一天之内出生的，你不应该有超过一天的时间来解决它们。所有这些任务都可以用蛮力来解决，但它总是最好的方法吗?(你可能无法访问所有这些任务，但它们将在地图上更开放的岛屿上可用)。
与第一项非常相似的是第二项任务，唯一的区别就是你应该以一种完全不同的方式来看待。你需要找到第一个最长的子串和所有的唯一字母。例如，在substring“abca”中，我们有两个带有唯一字母“abc”和“bca”的子字符串，但是我们应该选第一个，所以答案是“abc”。
